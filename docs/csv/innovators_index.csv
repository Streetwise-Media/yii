There is no need to purchase and integrate multiple disparate tools, learn different interfaces. For example, Akamai provides only back-end performance, but doesn't address front end optimization issues (heavy assets, numerous files, errors, etc.). Other competitors only provide website monitoring tools, but leave the optimization to you to handle. All Yottaa services work together in a closed-loop fashion to make your site fast, give it a global scale, and protect it around the clock - all automated. This provides you with the web infrastructure that in past was only within the reach of large companies.

We're also tech pioneers in the web performance space. Yottaa is a technology partner with the agility of a venture-backed startup, and the horsepower of a global organization.

6/4/2013 12:50:52,Abine,"Founded in 2008 by MIT engineers and entrepreneurs, Abine is taking on the tough work of privacy control so consumers around the world can rest easy. The company’s vision is to give people better control over their personal information online. Abine’s easy-to-use tools to make consumers smarter than data trackers. Abine is backed by premier Boston venture capital firms, Atlas Venture and General Catalyst Partners. In its first year at market, Abine products have been downloaded by millions in what is anticipated to be the next multi-billion dollar technology industry.

Abine is growing at 40-50% per quarter, with over 4 million installs to date (based on average install growth rate over past 2 quarters). Other trusted companies, such as Avira, now use Abine’s technology in their own software.
Abine’s DoNotTrackPlus, now known as DoNotTrackMe (DNTMe), first launched on February 2012 with an “outstanding” review from C|NET. Since then, the tool—which prevents tracking by advertisers and social networks—has blocked more than 3 billion attempts to track its users’ information. When it re-launched as DNTMe with new features and stronger protection, C|NET gave it a “spectacular” 5/5 review. Abine’s DeleteMe service, launched in December 2012, helps consumers find and remove personal data from the leading websites that collect, share, and sell it.

Abine has been recognized as an industry and product innovation leader with coverage in the New York Times, TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal and other top publications.

",http://abine-static.s3.amazonaws.com/images/logo512x512.png,33,"At Abine, we think online privacy should be easy, and that anyone who wants it should be able to get it. That's why we're building simple, effective, easy to use tools that give everyday web users more control over their personal information, like DoNotTrackMe (DNTMe).

The norm today is that companies try to make the most money they can by collecting, storing, and selling your personal information. We’re not one of them. Instead, we innovate around privacy: it’s our strong suit, our selling point, and what makes us different. Our freemium model lets us make money as a leader in privacy protection without compromising user data. The only way we get paid is if our users trust us to be responsible with their personal information. If we messed that up, we risk our entire business model. Our duty is to our customers and their privacy. Period.

Although small, open source tracker-blocking tools have existed in the past, they've failed to obtain mass-market adoption because they were just too complicated. DNTMe offers a simple, easy-to-use experience from installation to UI that gives everyday web users a say in whether they have online privacy. 

The list of trackers that DNTMe blocks is based on our web crawling system, invented in-house by our MIT engineers. The system crawls the web to detect new and evolving web trackers and add them to our ever-growing block list (which is currently at about 630 technologies and over 200 companies). The UC Berkeley Center for Law & Technology powers their recurring Web Privacy Census research with DNTMe's web crawler system. Global antivirus companies like Avira and CheckPoint (makers of ZoneAlarm), use DNTMe technology to power their own consumer software offerings.

DNTMe is a true privacy-by-design product: because it's a tool that that prevents online tracking, naturally we don't collect any data about our users. In fact, our entire culture, from privacy policies to product features to employee beliefs, centers on privacy. We don't use any trackers on our website, and our marketing team has to be creative to spread the word about our tools without the big databases that most web companies have today.

And our best privacy product is yet to come ;)",Private,"July 2011, $5.2M","[

Advertisers are desperately trying to keep up, and Jumptap helps them get there. Jumptap is the leading unified audience platform, taking a programmatic and mobile-first approach to reaching audiences across screens.
In the last 18 months, Jumptap added 20+ partnerships to on-board third-party data sources (ex: Polk, Axiom, Bluekai, Datalogix, etc.) to improve targeting of mobile ad campaigns; many of which were among the first in mobile. While these data sources were widely used to improve targeting in PC-based web advertising, no one had tried to deploy the data in mobile, where targeting itself is much harder – given the absence of a universal cookie or tracking mechanism, range of devices, difficulty of disparate operating platforms and carriers – all with their own technology protocols and privacy policies. 
In the past year, Jumptap also created and released consumer-level targeting, a privacy-friendly and measurable way to deliver the right ad to the right consumer. Additionally, the company released a cross-screen offering through a partnership with 24/7 Media. Jumptap can now help advertisers reach targeted audiences across mobile and PC in a single-buy. Of its 100M+ data-rich, individual audience profiles, 44M can be reached across screens – one of the largest cross-screen pools in the industry.
Finally, Jumptap entered — one of the first in mobile — into the real-time bidding (RTB) arena, which has allowed Jumptap to place ads on the most suitable publisher and app inventory by looking at, and bidding on, approximately two-billion ad impressions per day. Jumptap built its own RTB bidder in-house, and has developed proprietary algorithms to do predictive modeling and bidding, as well as signal-weighting, e.g. the signals from mobile consumer activity that are likely to produce accurate correlations to advertisers messages.

Its innovative approach to editorial content, fresh design and positive encouragement, along with its targeted distribution, have earned it endorsements and national awards in the last few years, as well as partnerships with organizations like Michelle Obama's Let's Move, and the US Department of Agriculture.

In May 2013, ChopChop was awarded The James Beard Publication of the Year Award. This award recognizes a publication—in magazine, newspaper, or digital format—that demonstrates fresh directions, worthy ambitions, and a forward-looking approach to food journalism. ChopChop Magazine is the only non-profit publication ever to win the award. The James Beard Foundation Awards are the nation’s preeminent recognition program honoring professionals in the food and beverage industries. Founded in 1986, the James Beard Foundation is dedicated to celebrating, nurturing, and preserving America’s diverse culinary heritage and future.

Endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and named as a “Best Practice in Childhood Obesity Prevention” by the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, ChopChop is distributed to more than 10,000 pediatricians’ offices nationwide— nearly half of all pediatric practices in the United States. And, through the generosity of the New Balance Foundation and the rest of its partners committed to child nutrition, ChopChop is distributed to neighborhood health centers and afterschool programs in underserved communities. All proceeds from subscriptions and donations help support the distribution of ChopChop to low-income families.

ChopChop is also the recipient of a 2013 gold award from the Parents’ Choice Foundation, the nation’s oldest nonprofit guide to quality children’s media and toys— the only cooking magazine ever to win this designation.

Here's the ChopChop Food Philosophy:
We believe in the simple values of cooking together as family and sharing healthy, delicious meals.
We don’t do calorie counts or post nutrition content, but everything in our publication is reviewed and approved by our medical and nutrition advisors.
We don’t demonize any individual foods.

Consumers support designers by pre-purchasing designs, which are put into production after a set period of time. Production is done in U.S. manufacturing facilities.

Because the apparel manufacturing cost structure is tiered, an increase in orders decreases the cost per piece, resulting in an increase in profit This allows designers to bootstrap and validate current market demand through sales, which are the gold standard for breaking into the fashion industry.

",,https://www.chattermob.com/assets/v3/images/logos/575x110.png,11,"The traditional model for conducting market research is broken. Focus groups cost too much, take too long to complete and tend to elicit answers that don't reflect what participants really think. Meanwhile, most survey tools are difficult to set up, deliver data that is complicated to interpret and/or don't allow businesses to ask direct follow-up questions to the individuals who answered those questions. The shortcomings of focus groups and survey websites are increasing the demand for better online market research tools. 

ChatterMob lets businesses of all sizes launch effective market research campaigns in three simple steps: 

1) Create and input questions and responses for a campaign
2) Choose the demographic they want to target
3) Select the number of responses they would like to receive 

Once launched, ChatterMob campaigns provide businesses with real-time updates and campaign progress as users respond to questions, as well as statistics and demographic information on the users who responded. Our major competitors rely on third parties to collect answers from users and aggregate the associated data. We built an in-house platform for these purposes. As a result, only ChatterMob can give businesses information on exactly who is answering their questions along with specific user demographics and pyshcographics. New features to come will allow clients interact directly with users and direct follow-up questions to specific user subsets. 

ChatterMob was launched in October 2012. In its first six months, with very little paid marketing, it attracted 5,000+ users who have collectively answered more than 1.3 million questions. Last month, we launched our iPhone app which has already had over 4,000 downloads. ChatterMob's innovative platform attracts users by making prize-winning fun and free and garners clients by making market research a cinch.",Private,N/A - We've been funded by our parent company,,Spencer Bramson,Founder,spencer@chattermob.com

While other LED lighting manufacturers have their roots in either electronics or traditional lighting, Lumenpulse’s distinctive combination of both industrial design and electronics knowhow has enabled the company to innovate ahead of its rivals and to offer more options for sustainable interior and exterior lighting.

Lumenpulse products embody a design philosophy that respects the aims of lighting specifiers and the needs of the end-user. The company designs and manufactures its durable, high-performance fixtures in families to ensure that they are simple to specify and configure.

The company’s design approach has been validated by significant commercial growth and industry recognition. In 2012, the company received a prestigious Red Dot Award for the design of its Lumenbeam LBX. Other recent accolades include an LFI innovation Award, two Next Generation Luminaires Awards, and several PIA awards from Architectural SSL magazine. Lumenpulse was also recognized as a Top New Growth Company in Profit Magazine’s Hot 50 in 2011.

",http://blog.utest.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Applause_logo.jpg ,"120+, 30+ specifically dedicated","Built by former Google and Microsoft data scientists with experience tackling some of the world’s toughest big data problems, Applause synthesizes data for millions of apps from millions of app reviews into an easy-to-consume 0-100 Applause Score for each app, graded across ten Applause Attributes. 
Receiving an app store star-rating of 3.2, a laundry list of reviews, and a simple download count is okay for a quick snapshot, but it doesn’t provide meaningful insights/direction about how to improve user satisfaction and app quality. Now, with Applause, companies can quickly and easily see results of deep data analysis and make informed decisions about where to best direct resources so apps perform as intended and provide the best customer experience possible. Applause data enables brands to improve mobile app quality, increase user satisfaction, and measure how their app stacks up per version, and against competition.

Essentially, the product consolidates ratings into one single pane, analyzes mountains of explicit user feedback about features, performance and usability, helps to understand what users are saying about the app, and competitors.

Applause Attributes: 
•	Content – relevance of an app’s or content across locations and cultures
•	Elegance – how attractive, cool or slick an app’s design is
•	Interoperability – how well an app integrates with other services or hardware
•	Performance – how fast and responsive an app is in standard usage
•	Pricing – how an app’s perceived value compares with its cost
•	Privacy – comfort with an app’s terms of service and handling of PII
•	Satisfaction – how well an app satisfies users’ core expectations 
•	Security – perceived risk to logins, passwords or other sensitive information 
•	Stability – how often the app crashes, hangs or freezes 
•	Usability – ease of navigation and discoverability among an app’s features

Existing analytics tools can help brands infer what users think based upon usage patterns, which is both valid and valuable. But when it comes to understanding what users are truly saying about how to make an app better, brands haven’t had the tools they need to listen effectively or efficiently. Applause can begin to build a true picture of an app over time and across versions.

Applause provides ongoing industry recognized thought leadership and trend identification with the Applause Index, offering the first-ever way to measure/ monitor the state of user satisfaction in the mobile apps economy, providing a daily look at how users feel about bell-weather iOS and Android apps with assigned, weighted, cumulative index scores similar to those used to measure the overall stock market. This enables journalists, analysts and company leaders to understand trends in the macro apps economy. You can also check out the Applause Commercial or Applause Product Tour to learn more. 

Applause has already been lauded by industry influences and received awards, including: 
•	3rd Place in CTIA E-Tech Enterprise Solution – General Business Awards;
•	2013 MITX Innovation Awards Winner – Most Insightful Big Data and Analytics Innovation;
•	2013 American Business Award Finalists for Tech Innovation of the Year;
•	Applause named Cool Vendor in Mobile Marketing, 2013 by Gartner;
•	2013 Global Mobile Awards Finalist in Best Enterprise Mobile Service Category

At AMP, we believe it is proactive problem solving and unmatched curiosity that are the key characteristics of innovators. Anyone can answer questions. It takes a different kind of thinker to solve problems that don’t exist yet. To see opportunities before everyone else does. That’s why AMP seeks out people with the kind of insatiable curiosity needed to drive innovative solutions for our clients, our agency and the advertising industry as a whole. To sum it up, we do not ask employees to “be innovative.” We ask them to “be visionary.” 

Through this “be visionary” philosophy, we have established strong partnerships with innovative companies that enable us to provide forward thinking solutions to our clients. For example, as one of 17 preferred agencies in the Google Partners program, we have exclusive access to test Google’s beta programs for our clients’ projects. 

What problems do you solve and how do you do so faster/smarter/better than competitors?

At AMP, we focus on connecting brands with people. In order to create the contextually relevant brand experiences online and offline to strengthen these relationships, we are constantly evolving our understanding of the latest technologies and methods of connecting the brand to the people.

1.	THE INSIGHTS LAB 
AMP Agency’s Insights Lab is a cross-departmental think tank dedicated to uncovering, understanding and leveraging the best ways to connect brands with people. In order to discover these opportunities, AMP employees are avid readers, researchers and writers. We house all of our thinking, analysis and predictions on 'what’s next' in the Insights Lab. Read a blog post about the latest event tracking technology, watch a video on the future of m-commerce or ponder the insights gained from an AMP proprietary study on the psychology of social media. AMP employees apply these learnings from the Insights Lab to recommend strategic, relevant solutions to clients. 

2.	BOSTON UNIVERSITY & AMP AGENCY’S INSIGHTS LAB INCUBATOR
We pride ourselves on constantly knowing the newest technologies and understanding consumer trends. This information helps us prognosticate about the future of marketing. And, we aim to share this knowledge with the innovators of tomorrow. That’s why we are hosting a first-of-its-kind, accredited Boston University class this Fall at AMP Agency. We are inviting 10 students to learn about the intersection of strategy, creative and technology and apply these learnings to “real-world,” client projects. We also anticipate that we will learn quite a bit from these digital natives. 


3.	THE R&D TEAM 
In order to promote and cultivate a culture of innovation, we have implemented an internal process that lets anyone, from developers to media planners, initiate an R&D project, recruit participants, and champion that initiative from inception to deployment. The latest prototype built by the R&D team is a facial-recognition platform that tracks event attendees in order for brands to measure unique visitors as well as success of various event components within the physical footprint. 

To deploy a successful project (both R&D and client work), we employ an agile development and project management process. This method allows teams to break up the project into small sprints, where each deliverable is a functional prototype of the product which they are building. Additionally, this process enables the team to identify flaws earlier on – thereby fixing and optimizing earlier in development and resulting in the best finished project. 

We believe the R&D team is critical to AMP’s position as an innovative company given the team leverages technology to solve clients' current problems and potentially future problems. Not to mention, we like to collaborate and build cool stuff.

Design Museum Boston is a new kind of museum. Like design, it’s everywhere and for everyone; it’s transformative and informative; it’s inviting and uniting.

Design Museum Boston is a newcomer to New England’s cultural landscape. We are the region’s first museum dedicated solely to design. Our mission is to educate the world on the role of design in their lives and to unite the Massachusetts design community in ways that enrich our collective work, make businesses more competitive, and solve real-world problems more creatively. After all, design has the power to make our everyday lives more comfortable, more efficient, more exciting, more rewarding, more… better.

We are inspired by revolutionary design: the fruitful result of thoughtful problem solving and a willingness to break with tradition. This is why our museum has no permanent address. Design Museum Boston is a decentralized network of physical and virtual exhibits. Whether in a gallery, retail environment, public spaces or on the web, our programming gives audiences new insights into the design process and the greater social, economic, and environmental contexts that both affect and are affected by design.",12 Channel St. S202,Boston,MA,2210,2009,Design,www.designmuseumboston.org,https://www.facebook.com/designmuseumboston?ref=ts,https://twitter.com/designmuseumbos,http://www.linkedin.com/company/design-museum-boston,http://designmuseumboston.org/news/,"Sam Aquillano, Co-Founder, Executive Director

It was an aggressive position at the time, but one that led to major change in the industry.  

Today, merchants and point-of-sale developers are struggling with rapidly evolving consumer payment technologies, reward and loyalty programs and other value-add offers designed to enhance the merchant-consumer experience. From the number of mobile payment options available to reinforcing security and protecting consumer data, emerging payment technologies and related value-add programs are viewed as a source of confusion and disruption.  

With the recent launch of Genius™, Merchant Warehouse has again changed the landscape of the payment solutions industry. A Customer Engagement Platform™, Genius delivers a unified platform solution for merchants, POS developers, value added resellers (VARs) and agents that aggregates and integrates every conceivable transaction technology, payment type, and value-add program. Our vision is to revolutionize the payments solution industry by providing innovative technology solutions and transparent services to simplify and increase the flexibility and value associated with the merchant-customer payment process and experience.

In mid-2011 as mobile began its accelerated adoption curve, Henry launched an internal project around new payment technologies.

Advertisers are desperately trying to keep up, and Jumptap helps them get there. Jumptap is the leading unified audience platform, taking a programmatic and mobile-first approach to reaching audiences across screens.
In the last 18 months, Jumptap added 20+ partnerships to on-board third-party data sources (ex: Polk, Axiom, Bluekai, Datalogix, etc.) to improve targeting of mobile ad campaigns; many of which were among the first in mobile. While these data sources were widely used to improve targeting in PC-based web advertising, no one had tried to deploy the data in mobile, where targeting itself is much harder – given the absence of a universal cookie or tracking mechanism, range of devices, difficulty of disparate operating platforms and carriers – all with their own technology protocols and privacy policies. 
In the past year, Jumptap also created and released consumer-level targeting, a privacy-friendly and measurable way to deliver the right ad to the right consumer. Additionally, the company released a cross-screen offering through a partnership with 24/7 Media. Jumptap can now help advertisers reach targeted audiences across mobile and PC in a single-buy. Of its 100M+ data-rich, individual audience profiles, 44M can be reached across screens – one of the largest cross-screen pools in the industry.
Finally, Jumptap entered — one of the first in mobile — into the real-time bidding (RTB) arena, which has allowed Jumptap to place ads on the most suitable publisher and app inventory by looking at, and bidding on, approximately two-billion ad impressions per day. Jumptap built its own RTB bidder in-house, and has developed proprietary algorithms to do predictive modeling and bidding, as well as signal-weighting, e.g. the signals from mobile consumer activity that are likely to produce accurate correlations to advertisers messages.

Avoiding a single mistake can save you months of wasted effort, but you can only do that if your learning is always ahead of where you are at in your business.

2. My competitors focus on techniques and strategies for learning faster, such as speed reading or memory techniques. My company solves the bigger problem which is that if you are an entrepreneur you are learning on your own and you don't have a system for structuring your learning, something that is usually provided in schools. I have created a system, a framework for how to learn anything from start to finish so that you can stay organized and use all the accelerated learning strategies my competitors offer and more in one tightly integrated system. 

The biggest issue entrepreneurs have is lack of organization in their learning and not taking enough action. These are both systemic problems that cannot be solved by new strategies or techniques, and when I realized this in my own learning I decided to create a system that would incorporate the best strategies of accelerated learning into one unified methodology.

Campaign intricacy is accelerating with products, POP, kits, and creative going out to stores on a more frequent basis. Retailers have lost confidence in their stores’ ability to execute localized campaigns quickly or effectively. In addition, communication from headquarters to stores typically lacks timeliness and relevance.

While many services provide content curation tools for consumers and publishers, there’s a major void for curation assistance in the business space.  As a result, businesses, in spite of the heightened demand for curation, are not always able to best engage with customers because they lack the bandwidth to execute a content curation strategy.

To address this widespread issue, Curata lets marketers build authoritative content destinations without the hassle of manually finding and sharing content.  Curata facilitates engagement with its customers’ brands by helping to keep audiences current, boosting SEO so audiences can find content and establishing thought leadership to ensure brand trust.  By compiling this information in a single, easy-to-use site, Curata offers a simple and valuable way for businesses to interact with customers. Curata also integrates with all CMS platforms, allowing marketers to find the content they are looking and use it where their customers are. 

Curata has the ability to drive change in the overall market by helping businesses of all industries more easily identify, organize and share the most relevant content with their respective audiences.  And when businesses share the timeliest and most pertinent curated content on news portals, social media properties and original blogs, it also helps manage the flood of content facing consumers.  Consumers will no longer have to cut through the clutter of disorganized, irrelevant content often distributed by marketers, and instead will have easy access to the news they care most about.

While Google and Salesforce have disaster recovery plans for the data they store on their servers, they unfortunately have limited functionality when it comes to getting your data back if it’s lost for reasons other than hardware failure or disasters - such as human error. 

According to an Aberdeen Research report “SaaS Data Loss: The Problem You Didn’t Know You Had” 32% of companies surveyed lost data from a SaaS application and the most common instance of data loss comes from end-user deletion. 

Companies can lose data from accidental deletion and user mistakes, over-writing data, and malicious actions (ex. rogue employees, hackers). 

Backupify gives companies an automated, daily backup of their data. Information is readily available when a company needs it (including an instance of user error or deletion). Companies using Backupify can “set it and forget it” with instant peace of mind that all their data is backed-up.

1.  Our platform -- We created and operate the only payroll direct deposit platform for rent that enables us to receive ""installments"" toward rent on a prorated basis every payday for enrolled individuals. We track and report on all funds received each pay period, which enables us to also provide an early warning to rental communities of a payment issue that could arise when rent is due.

2. More affordable access to rental housing -- We provide a solution for rental applicants with less than perfect credit to gain access to  housing without punitive security deposits that are typically charged when credit is below the standard requirements and can often make a housing option beyond reach. These savings can represent as much as 1.5 additional month's rent in order to obtain a lease as well as standard move in costs.of a few hundred dollars on top of first month's rent,

3. A money management tool -- Because funds from payroll are forwarded through our platform every pay period before they become discretionary, we help residents to better budget their pay. In this process, we also help residents to avoid late fees for late rent payments which range from $50-$150 per incident.  

4. Credit building tool --  As part of our mission to help residents build or rebuild credit, all funds disbursed through our program are reported to a national credit bureau, PRBC, the leading depository of recurring payments.

5.  A new business category -- In addition to helping rental applicants, we have created a new B2B service category for rental operators who had no other automated payment option to offer to lower credit consumers.  With our program, NPS Rent Assurance, our clients are now able to move in more residents with the tools to pay reliably, leading to increased revenue and marked improvement in renter stability through more reliable payment performance.

},",http://leaf.me/downloads/Leaf-Press-Resources.zip,27,"Leaf is redefining how small business owners operate their storefronts and connect with their customers. Leaf built a platform that serves as a hub for local merchants to run and grow their business while engaging with customers in the new digital age. Out-of-the-box, Leaf gives small business owners the hardware and software they need to combine Point-of-Sales (POS), payment acceptance, business analytics, loyalty offerings and other business functionality into a single, cost-effective offering.

There are three parts to the Leaf platform:

The LeafPresenter™ is the first tablet specifically designed for commerce. The tablet lets small business owners create a virtual version of their store: catalogs, items, customers, employees and inventory. The device can be set up in minutes and is designed to be handheld or stationary in its base so merchants can immediately begin taking orders and processing payments via their choice of processor, gift card provider, next generation payment method (such as PayPal and LevelUp), or mobile wallets.

LeafBusiness™ is an online management and analytics dashboard for business owners to operate and grow their business. Accessible from any device, (tablet, phone, PC, etc.), LeafBusiness’ newsfeed alerts the business owners on the most interesting events taking place at his storefront in real time. It is also optimized for seamless inventory and employee management, as well as simple yet powerful real-time data reporting and analytics. On the go, or from the comfort of their own home, owners can now access all their data and make informed decisions regarding their business.

The Leaf Appstore™ is the first app store dedicated to serving the needs of brick and mortar businesses and completes the company’s vision by enabling third parties to supplement and extend the core features in its technology platform. This enables Leaf to serve as the underlying platform for SMB commerce upon which its services and those of others run on a single device.

There are 8.5 million brick & mortar (offline) merchants in the US and less than 1% use cloud-based solutions that are bringing cost and operational efficiencies to other industries. Additionally, SMB merchants are increasingly under attack from traditional big box and online competitors armed with sophisticated tools for data analytics and customer engagement. 

Numerous startup and legacy players in the SMB space are offering payment acceptance, business analytics, loyalty and other business services to help compete against the growing competition. However, these offerings are highly fragmented requiring multiple solutions and devices, leaving the merchant overwhelmed by new technology choices.  Leaf is the first platform to aggregate all these services, arming the merchant with one feature-rich mobile POS and a cloud-based business management and analytics tool to provide insight into their business like they’ve never had before. 

Leaf’s open approach to payment acceptance enables merchants to choose what’s right for them and their customers – from virtually any credit or gift card processor to next generation payment options and mobile wallets.  Packed with the latest technology including Near Field Communications (NFC), Europay MasterCard Visa (EMV), front and back cameras, speakers and a microphone, the LeafPresenter is a “futureproof” device that will work with most any payment option now and in the future.  The Leaf Appstore will make customizing a POS or adopting new payment methods as easy as downloading an app to a smartphone.  Overall, Leaf is the foundation upon which an SMB merchant can run and grow all aspects of their business.
